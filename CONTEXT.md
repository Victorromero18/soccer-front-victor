# Project Learning Context

## About This Project

This is my first React project, and I'm using it to learn:

- ⚛️ **React** - Components, hooks, state management
- 🎨 **UX/UI Design** - Creating attractive, user-friendly interfaces
- 🎯 **Frontend Best Practices** - Code structure, patterns, maintainability

## My Background

- ❌ No prior React experience
- ❌ No UX/UI design experience
- ✅ Learning by building a real-world application (Soccer Tournament Management)

## Learning Resources I'm Using

- **Documentation**: `/docs/MODULE1.md` - Complete implementation guide
- **Design**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for pre-built components
- **Backend**: Already implemented in `/Users/alberrtor/projects/soccer-backend`

## Goals

1. Build a functional authentication system (Module 1)
2. Learn React fundamentals through practical application
3. Understand modern frontend development workflow
4. Create professional-looking UIs using component libraries

## Notes for AI Assistant

When helping me:
- Explain React concepts clearly
- Provide design templates I can follow
- Show step-by-step implementations
- Use shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS examples
- Don't assume I know frontend terminology
